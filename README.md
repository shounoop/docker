# Docker - Build once, run anywhere

## Overview

- Docker is a tool that helps package and deploy applications in an easy, reliable and portable way. It enables developers and system administrators to create containers that hold applications and their dependencies, which can run on any environment supported by Docker.
- A Docker container is an isolated environment that contains all the libraries and tools necessary to run you application. By using Docker, you can package your application and its dependencies into a container, then deploy that container on any server supported by Docker, helping to minimize the differences between different deployment environments.
- Dock also provides users with a library of pre-build images. allowing you to start containers from these images instead of building them from scratch. This saves time and effort in the deployment process.

> In summary, Docker is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of packing and deploying your application across different evironments, as well as increasing the mobility and reliablity of your application.
