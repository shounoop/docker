# docker-compose

The docker-compose command is used to manage multi-container Docker applications. You can use it to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

For example, to start a multi-container application defined in a docker-compose.yml file, you can use the following command:

```cmd
docker-compose up
```

This command will start all the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file and attach them to a network named after the project directory.

You can also use the docker-compose command to stop and remove the containers using the following command:

```cmd
docker-compose down
```
